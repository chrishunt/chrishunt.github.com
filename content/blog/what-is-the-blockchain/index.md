You know a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)? Then you
get the gist. It's a node, with some data, and a previous. But this is what I
missed when I started this, the secret to the chain is SHA-256. Or
[KECCAK-256](https://keccak.team/index.html) if you're mining the
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/). It's like SHA-3, but it's not. Check the
medium.com. I'm sure you'll find a blog post. Know what matters most is that
we hash when we link the nodes.

This hashing, if you're asking, takes a long time by design. That's why people
like to call it "mining". They're supplying evidence of work, of stake, and
time.  It's called "buy in".

When you make real tough to grow the chain, you make it real tough to break the
chain. And when we all have the chain, we all trust the chain.
