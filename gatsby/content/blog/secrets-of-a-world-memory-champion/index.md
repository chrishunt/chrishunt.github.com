You don't have a bad memory, you were just never taught how to use it. We are
going to practice several powerful memory techniques that have been perfected
by memory contest champions over the last hundred years. By the end of this
talk, you will know how to quickly memorize a foreign language, driving
directions, phone conversations, the entire Chuck Norris filmography, your
friend's credit card number, a shuffled deck of playing cards, and the name of
every person you meet at RailsConf.
